    Good morning, thank you for the chance to introduce myself. My name is husenfeng, and I am a final year student at Henan Agricultural University.
    I have got prizes in The Chinese Mathematics Competitions and have passed the CET 4, 6.
    Besides, I'm ready to learn new things, and I'm very good with numbers.
    I think these qualities will make me a good researcher.

    Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology has always been my dream school. It has such strong computer science background.
    And Nanjing is such an amazing city, especially for a student who wants dive into a deep study atmosphere.
    If I were to be admitted into this college, I would be so proud of myself and embark on an in-depth study of machine learning with my best performance.
    That's all, thank you.
